# editablePluginV2
EditablePluginV2 is a second version (modular version) of my repository editablePluginv1.

<edit-me> directive will let you edit the field and give you two options "Save" and "Cancel".

Once you add <edit-me> directive beside the text, it will give you the edit button beside the text!

Here is the screenshot of how the webpage will look like:
(**These values are fetched from the MongoDB and will be updated as and when edited.**)

Once you click edit, it will give you options to select from the list. You can choose from "Manager", "Employee" and "Recruiter".
You can either save the information or edit the information, the plugin will handle the changes for you!
